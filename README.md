# ajitabh-scripts
A collection of quick and dirty scripts I used for routine work.

## Digital Ocean Automation

All scripts under ```digital_ocean``` folder. I typically use the official ```doctl``` commandline client, so you may need a functioning ```doctl``` installation. Refer [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-doctl-the-official-digitalocean-command-line-client) for more details on how to setup and use the ```doctl```.

## Notifications Scripts

The scripts under notifications are used for various types of notification a.k.a SMS, telegram etc

* way2sms.pl - This perl script can send SMS using provider [[WAY2SMS](https://www.way2sms.com/)

## Miscellaneous Scripts

* stream_downloaded.sh - This shell script runs in a loop till a live stream becomes available and downloads it.
